# Methods

The Poudre River at Lincoln Bridge is:

  - Downstream of only a little bit of urban stormwater

  - Near Odell Brewing CO
  
  - Near an open space area and the Poudre River Trail
  
  - **Downstream of many agricultural diversions**

# Data Acquisition and Plotting Tests

## Data Download


```{r downloader}

q <- readNWISdv(siteNumbers = '06752260',
                parameterCd = '00060',
                startDate = '2017-01-01',
                endDate = '2022-01-01') %>%
  rename(q = 'X_00060_00003')


```



## Static Data Plotter


```{r, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5}

ggplot(q, aes(x = Date, y = q)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ylab('Q (cfs)') + 
  ggtitle('Discharge in the Poudre River, Fort Collins')

```


## Interactive Data Plotter


```{r}

q_xts <- xts(q$q, order.by = q$Date)


dygraph(q_xts) %>%
  dyAxis("y", label = "Discharge (cfs)") 
```



# Assignment


This assignment will be primarily about demonstrating some expertice in using
RMarkdown, since we will be using Rmds as the primary form of homework and 
assignments. With that in mind, your assignment for this homework is to:


1) Fork the example repository into your personal GitHub

2) Create an RStudio project from your Personal clone of the Repo. 

3) Create a table of contents that is floating, but displays three levels of
headers instead of two (by editing the content at the beginning of the document)

4) Make a version of the `dygraph` with points and lines by using rstudio's
dygraph [guide](https://rstudio.github.io/dygraphs/)

5) Writing a paragraph on the Poudre river with at least three hyperlinks,
**two bolded sections**, and one *italicized phrase*. The content of this paragraph
is not vital, but try to at least make it true and interesting, and, of course,
don't plagiarize. 

6) Knit that document, and then git commit and push to your personal GitHub.

7) Use the GitHub -> Settings -> Pages tab to create a website of your report.

8) Bonus, make the timestamp in the header dynamic. As in it only adds
todays date, not just a static date you enter. 

9) Bonus, create an "index_talk.Rmd" version of your document using the
`revealjs` package. Add link to your original report-style document. 




## DyGraph example

```{r}
dygraph(q_xts) %>%
  dyOptions(drawPoints = TRUE, pointSize = 2)
  
```

## Poudre Paragraph


**The History of the Poudre River**

The Cache la Poudre River got its name from a group of French trappers that hid their gun powder on the banks of the river to lighten their wagons. Hence the translation of the name to be the *"hiding place of the powder."* Since the 1800's, the Poudre River has been a vital resource for the Northern Colorado community. From industrial to agricultural and to residential use, the water from the Poudre river is in great demand. 

**Poudre River Geomorphology**

The Poudre River starts high in the [Rocky Mountain National Park](https://www.nps.gov/romo/index.htm) peaks and flows north east through the [Roosevelt National Forest](https://www.fs.usda.gov/arp), slowly making its way through the city of Fort Collins. There are a lot of [recreational activities](https://www.visitftcollins.com/things-to-do/parks-open-spaces/cache-la-poudre-river/) that occur along the river, including hiking, biking, kayaking, and white water rafting. However, because of the multiple reservoirs that consume water from the Poudre, the once rapid, flowing river is now only a trickling stream in some areas, especially during the winter months.
